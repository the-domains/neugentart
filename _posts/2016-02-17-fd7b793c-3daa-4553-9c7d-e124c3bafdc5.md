This is the beginning of a new chapter in the story

of Charles Neugent art. I'm struggling, once again

to create a website that will actually do what I need it 

to do and also please all of the people who have complained

about my other website that's been under contruction for

about five or six years now. This website will be made by 

the Grid. It attracted me because they said that it would make

itself. So, here I am once again, struggling to create a website

that will .............oh well, you know the rest. Thank You for

showing an interest in my work. It means the world to me.
